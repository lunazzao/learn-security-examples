• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.
The code is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to its lack of secure authentication and authorization checks. 
Specifically, the route '/update-role' allows any user who can submit the correct userId and newRole parameters to change a user's role, 
potentially to an admin, without verifying the identity or the privileges of the requester. This vulnerability is compounded by the 
absence of any logging or auditing mechanism, which means users could deny performing such actions, leading to repudiation issues.


• What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such
attacks?
Secure Version Improvement:
A more secure version would implement robust authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., admins) 
can update roles. Additionally, it would include detailed logging of all user actions, including attempts to update roles. These logs 
would capture the user's identity, the action attempted, and the time of the action. This way, even if a user tries to deny their actions, 
the system has an immutable record that can prove otherwise, thereby preventing repudiation.
