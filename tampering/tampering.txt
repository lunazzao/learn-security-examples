Tampering refers to a security vulnerability where an attacker has the capability to alter or manipulate the data entered by users. 
This type of vulnerability is particularly concerning because it directly challenges the integrity of the system's data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other forms of security breaches. 
To fight this, a critical preventive measure involves sanitizing user input. This process include thoroughly checking and cleaning all incoming data to ensure that it does not contain any malicious elements that could be used to tamper with the system. By implementing input sanitization, the system can effectively guard against attempts to manipulate data, thereby maintaining its integrity and ensuring that the data remains accurate, reliable, and unaltered by unauthorized parties. This safeguard is essential in building a secure and trustworthy digital environment.
